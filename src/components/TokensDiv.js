                A post pandemic economy requires tools that are not only forward looking, but also socially responsive, innovative and profitable to all that interact with them. This is where the $ILX stands out.
            </p>
            <p className='content'>
                The governance DAO will propose to lock a portion of the proceeds toward the creation of our first pet project, the ILX Initiative. This is a non profit dedicated to rehabilitating urban city dwellers and post pandemic refugees that seeks to return to the land and life in semi rural, country settings.

                The rise of mega over-populated cities has greatly accelerated the expansion and access to wealth and convenience for tens of millions around the globe; sadly its has also contributed to the societal problems of homelessness, hunger, strife, disease and broken urban landscapes.
            </p>
            <p className='content'>
                The ILX Initiative will, with the consent of the DAO, help fund the acquisition, planning, development and deployment of a catalogue of new, rural tech/farming frontiers and ecosystems with each of them boasting a 1000-hectare self sustaining farm holding hubs/communities in designated problem areas around the world, known to us as the Oasis Project (See Whitepaper for Details)
            </p>
            <p className='content'>
                Long term aim is to make the $ILX the sole means of commerce within the borders of these hubs, ensuring not only continued liquidity but a market uptick of our native token and sound investment asset for the holders.
